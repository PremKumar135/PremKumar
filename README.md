## Project 1: Chorus Detection
> This project is a music retrieval system which is detecting the instances of chorus section in the music recording. Generally, chorus section in the audio represents the most repetitive part in the song.

`Tools` : AWS EC2, python, Docker, Flask.    
`Technology` : Machine Learning, Audio Processing, Image Processing.   
`Algorithm`: DBSCAN.   

* Given an audio, we are finding the
