#### **Project 1: Chorus Detection**  
---
> This project is a music retrieval system which is detecting the instances of chorus section in the music recording. Generally, chorus section in the audio represents the most repetitive part in the song.

**`Tools:`** AWS EC2, Python, Docker, Flask.    
**`Technology:`**  Machine Learning, Audio Processing, Image Processing.
**`Algorithm:`** DBSCAN.  

##### **Responsibility:**
* Given an audio, convert the audio into time-time similarity matrix and time-lag similarity matrix using  chorma features.
* Smoothing and binarize the similarity matrix using image processing techniques
* Finding the clusters using in the binarized image which represents the similar parts in the audio.
* Finding the matching chorus using python
* Trim the found choruses from the audio and split the audio into vocal component and Accompaniment component
* After splitting the audio, finding the presence of voice using Spectral Energy.
* The model is packaged into docker container and the model package is published in the AWS MarketPlace.


#### **Project 2: Similar Image Retrieval** 
---
> This project is a similar image retrieval system which is given an query image retrieving the similar images in the database of images.

**`Tools:`**  AWS EC2, python, Elastic Search, AWS Sagemaker.   
**`Technology:`** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing.    
**`Algorithm:`** K-Nearest Neighbor, ResNet.    

##### **Responsibility:**
* The task here is to given a query image retrieving all the similar images in the database.
* Used ResNet to find the encoding of all the available images in the dataset.
* Upload all the image feature encodings in the AWS ElasticSearch with unique id for each image.
* Now, given a query image, found the ResNet model to find out the encodings of the query image and used elastic search KNN to find the k nearest neighbors
* Those K neighbors will be the similar images for the given query image.
